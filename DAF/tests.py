    # * Look at accuracy as a function of sigma

    # * Look at delta(x) graphs

    # * Can sigma be scaled so that the zeros of the expansion align with 
    #   the nearby x points? 

    # Try a sinusoidal basis on [-pi,pi]. Will likely take many, many more functions
    # to get convergence, but it may be easier for finding zeros in the delta function
    # expansion.
