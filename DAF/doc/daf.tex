\section{Mathematical Backgound}

The distributed approximating functionals (DAF) method was developed 
and implemented for solving classes of differential equations very accurately
with a high fidelity to the accuracy of derivatives. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Differential Equations}: The DAF method constructs matrix operators that
	can be applied to multidimentional linear differential equations. 
\item{\bf Interpolation}: The DAF method can be used to approximate functions and
	their derivatives with high accuracy. 
\end{enumerate}
