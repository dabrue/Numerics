\section{Lagrange Interpolating Polynomials}
The use of the DVR \cite{DVR1986} method requires a set of orthogonal functions to 
be used as a basis set. These basis functions are then used to construct the 
matrix elements for the potential and kinetic energy operators of the Hamiltonian. 
The Lagrange interpolating polynomials are a good choice for this because the 
number and distributions of points is highly flexible, and the functions are
orthogonal by definition. This method of using Lagrange interpolating polynomials for
DVR methods was introduced by Rescigno and McCurdy in reference \cite{FEMDVR2000}. 
Figure \ref{lip6} shows an example of six Lagrange interpolating
polynomials over the range of -1 to 1. Each polynomial is defined by a set of 
abscissa points, $\mathcal X$, and are frequently written as 
\begin{equation}
\label{lipdef}
\lambda_k(x)=\prod_{j \ne k}^n\frac{(x-x_j)}{(x_k-x_j)},
\end{equation}
such that $\lambda_i(x_i)=1$ and $\lambda_i(x_{n\ne k})=0$ where $x_i$,$x_n\in \mathcal X$. 
The interpolant of a set of points, $f(x_i)$ which are the functions values of $f$ defined
at the set of points $\mathcal X$, can be constructed by summing over the interpolating
polynomial functions as
\begin{equation}
\label{interpdef}
F(x)=\sum_i^n \lambda_i(x)f(x_i)
\end{equation}
By this method, the points at which the function is known are reproduced exactly 
and the function value at all points in between are defined by an $n^{th}$ order
polynomial. 

\begin{figure}[b]
\includegraphics{lip6.eps}
\caption {Plotted here are a set of six-point Lagrange Interpolating functions with
abscissas equally spaced between -1 and 1. One function is equal to 1 at each of the
six abscissas, and the rest of the functions are zero. To show this, the line $y=1$ is
also plotted with points noting where each polynomial is 1. }
\label{lip6}
\end{figure}

These functions are not orthogonal to each other with respect to the integral of 
these functions over the region defined. However, if the integration is performed
by a quadrature at the points of $\mathcal X$, then they {\it are} orthogonal, as
the functions integrated over only share a non-zero value at the same $x_m$ if they 
are the same function. This does not imply that these functions are normalized, 
however, as the quadrature summation also includes weight factors, and thus, 
\begin{equation}
\label{liportho}
\int_{a}^{b}\lambda_m(x)\lambda_n(x)\dx \ne \sum_j^n\lambda_m(x_j)\lambda_n(x_j)w_j = \delta_{nm}w_j
\end{equation}
Where for generality I have replaced the domain of $[-1,1]$ with $[a,b]$. The
set of points $\mathcal X$ between $[-1,1]$ can be moved and scaled to arbitrary domains
by a linear transformation. 

As can be noted from figure \ref{lip6}, while the functions are zero at the 
appropriate points, they can still have very significant amplitude between the points
where they are required to be zero. For this reason, lower order polynomial 
interpolants are often preferred to reduce ``ringing'' between adjacent points. 

\section{Calculation of Quadrature Weights for Arbitrary Abscissas}
The calculation of the integration weights can be done by creating a matrix of functions
defined at the abscissa values, multiplying this matrix by the unknown array of weights, 
and making this equal to the known values of the integrals. To ensure that the combination
of $n$ weights and an arbitrarily spaced set of $n$ abscissas exactly integrate any 
polynomial of degree $n-1$, we would use polynomials of degrees $0$ through $n-1$,
labeled as $p_i$, for the functions in the matrix. The index represents the 
order of the polynomial, so $p_0$ would be a constant function, and the matrix 
of polynomials evaluated at the abscissa points would be, generally, 
\begin{equation}
\label{genPmat}
{\bf P} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
p_0(x_1) & p_0(x_2) & \dots & p_0(x_n) \\
p_1(x_1) & p_1(x_2) & \dots & p_1(x_n) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
p_n(x_1) & p_n(x_2) & \dots & p_n(x_n) 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

For example, a three point quadrature with three polynomials must solve the
equation
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
p_0(x_1) & p_0(x_2) & p_0(x_3) \\
p_1(x_1) & p_1(x_2) & p_1(x_3) \\
p_2(x_1) & p_2(x_2) & p_2(x_3) 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
w_1\\
w_2\\
w_3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
I_0\\
I_1\\
I_2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $I_n$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
I_n=\int_a^bp_n(x)\dx 
\end{equation}

Multiplying on the left by the inverse of the matrix of polynomials will give a solution
for the vector of weights. In this three point example, it ensures that the abscissas
and weights provided will exactly reproduce integrals of polynomials of order two or less. 

In this example, polynomials only up to order two were used, that is, only quadratic
polynomials, which is expected to be the best achievable from a three point formula. In
order to exactly calculate all polynomials of order two or less, it is necessary in 
the three point example that the other two polynomials chosen to construct 

\section{Quadrature Formulae with Optimized Abscissas and Weights}

In the last section it was shown that by simple matrix manipulation, the $n$ weights
required to exactly integrate an $n$ point quadrature provided the function being
integrated could be represented by a polynomial of order $n-1$. However, it is possible
to improve on this by an appropriate choice of abscissas. 

The only requirement on the choice of abscissas for the DVR method is that the 
end points be included in the abscissas. If there are no other requirements on the 
points, such as a specific distribution pattern, this extra freedom can be employed
to increase the accuracy of the quadrature formula. For many Gauss-type quadratures, this
will allow integrals of up to $2n-1$ order to be calculated exactly. This accuracty
cannot be achieved with Lobatto's Integration formula (see appendix \ref{lobatappend})
because two of the abscissas are fixed. But, it is possible to achieve exact integration
of a $2n-3$ order polynomial with
Lobatto's Integration formula \cite{ABRW-STGN} with 
the integration defined as,
\begin{equation}
\label{lobatint}
\int_{-1}^1f(x)\dx=\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\left(f(1)+f(-1)\right)+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1}f(x_i)w_i
\end{equation}
It is noteworthy that many authors
refer to the Lagrange interpolating polynomials defined in eqn. \ref{lipdef} as Lobatto
Shape Functions or some varient thereof. \cite{Manolop_Wyatt_1988}
The abscissas for this quadrature are the roots of the first derivative
of the Legendre polynomial of order $n-1$, $P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$. The weights are
given by the relation
\begin{equation}
\label{lobatW}
w_i=\frac{2}{n(n-1)(P_{n-1}(x_i))^2}
\end{equation}
where $P_{n-1}$ is the Legendre polynomial of order $n-1$ \cite{ABRW-STGN}. 

Using this distribution of abscissas and their corresponding weights allows for
a quadrature formula that provides exact integration of all polynomials order $2n-1$
or less with the same number of points. Furthermore, by inclusion of the end points, 
it is also suitable for use in the DVR method, which requires the endpoints to be included
in the quadrature formulae to ensure continuity of the integrands. 

\section{Linking Multiple Quadratures and Scaling}
\subsection{Defining Lagrange Interpolating Polynomials over Multiple Regions}
The vast majority of the time the desired integral is not over a domain of -1 to 1, but
by simple change of variable the integral can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\label{scaleint}
\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)\dx = \frac{2}{b-a}\int_a^bf(y)\dy
\end{equation}
Where we make the replacement
\begin{equation}
\label{scalex}
y = \left(\frac{b-a}{2}\right)x+\left(\frac{b+a}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
By use of equation \ref{scalex} the abscissa values can be recast over any range. 
This gives the ability to repleatedly apply the quadrature formula of equation 
\ref{lobatint} over a large region, thus splitting it into ``elements''. The 
element boundaries can be feely chosen, even if the the dispersion of points within
the elements are not. Thus, the density of points in the integration can easily 
be manipulated, and more points can be placed in regions where the integrand is 
more interesting. 

Linking multiple quadratures together is desireable and often necessary to avoid
using high order polynomials. 
High order polynomial interpolations can cause ringing
between points, thus not well representing the function. Forcing the polynomial
to pass through each function point exactly can cause the polynomial interpolation
to oscillate to extreme values in order to satisfy the constraints. To avoid this, 
lower order polynomials are used to interpolate sets of points within each element, 
and the integration is then performed for each element. 
The LIP functions used in each 
element can be defined to be zero outside of their element, 
\begin{equation}
\label{lipdomain}
\lambda_{\xi,i}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}
    {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
    \lambda_{\xi,i}(x) & x_{\xi,1} < x < x_{\xi,n_\xi} \\
    0 & x < x_{\xi,1}, x> x_{\xi,n_\xi}
    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
where $\xi$ labels the element, $i$ labels the $i^{th}$ function in that
element, and $n_\xi$ labels how many functions, and points, are defined within
that element. 

The definition of equation \ref{lipdomain} ensures that 
that the whole set of LIP functions for all elements are orthogonal.
Furthermore, by splitting the integration range into elements, 
the DVR matrices are much more simple than they would be if one
set of polynomials was used to interpolate the entire region, as will be 
seen in later sections.  

Linking multiple elements together results from dividing the integration
region into elements and applying the Lobatto integration formula in each 
element such that the full integral is performed by a summation of quadratures. 
\begin{align}
\label{lobatsplit}
\int_a^zf(x)\dx & = \int_a^bf(x)\dx+\int_b^cf(x)\dx+\dots+\int_y^zf(x)\dx \\
\label{lobatint1}
&=\sum_{\xi=a}^{z}\left[\frac{2}{n_\xi(n_\xi-1)}\left(f(x_{\xi,1})+
f(x_{\xi,n_\xi})\right) +\sum_{i=2}^{n_\xi-1}f(x_{\xi,i})w_{\xi,i}\right]
\end{align}
From this formula the integration can be performed over any number of elements,
each consisting of a small enough number of points to avoid ringing effects, 
while still maintaining a high level of accuracy. And, as mentioned previously, 
allows for the freedom to distribute points and elements to maximize their
effectiveness. One is not forced to conform to the distribution of quadrature 
abscissas over the entire integral. 

\subsection{Continuity of the Wavefunction}
There is a further complication that must be addressed before this basis
set of LIP functions can be used in a basis expansion of the wavefunction: 
the issue of continuity. 
At each element boundary, there are two LIP functions that have a value of 1
at the boundary edge. For the boundary between element $\xi$ and $\xi+1$ these
are the last LIP function in set $\xi$ and the first in set $\xi+1$. This 
is shown in figure \ref{bridgechi} using the example six-point functions
defined earlier. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics{bridge6.eps}
\caption {This plot is an example of a ``bridging'' function between two elements. 
From -2 to 0 is the plot of the last function of one element, and from 0 to 2 is
the first function of the next element. Combining them into one basis gives a
single function, still orthogonal to all of the rest with respect to the quadrature,
and ensures continuity at the element boundaries. }
\label{bridgechi}
\end{figure}

Discontinuity is not a problem when integrating a function whose value is known at 
this point -- both functions are multiplyed by the value $f(x=x_{n_\xi})$. 
However, when using these functions as a basis set expansion, the coefficients
are not known ahead of time. This means there is no assurance that these two
functions will have the same coefficient, and thus, no assurance that the 
wavefunction will be continuous. 

Following Rescigno and McCurdy \cite{FEMDVR2000}, the simple solution to this
is to combine these two functions, the last of each element with the first
of the next element, into one basis function. We can therefore cast a new basis
set, defined as
\begin{align}
\label{chibasistmp}
\chi_{\xi,n_\xi}(x)&=\frac{1}{2}\left[\lambda_{\xi,n_\xi}(x)+\lambda_{\xi+1,1}(x)\right] \\
\chi_{\xi,i}(x)&=\lambda_{\xi,i}(x), \qquad i=2,n_\xi-1
\end{align}
where for undefined or non-existing elements the LIP function is assumed to be zero. 

Here we have made a different definition than Rescigno and McCurdy in that 
the ``bridging'' function between the elements is the sum of the two functions
{\it dividied by two}. This ensures that the basis function value at this point
remains 1. While the functions are still orthogonal and not normalized, this is 
only a point made for consistancy with the other functions.  This also reduces
the total number of basis functions by $M-1$, where $M$ is the number of 
elements. 

\subsection{Basis Function Normalization}
To be used for DVR matrices, the basis functions must be normalized with 
respect to the quadrature. The functions defined in equations \ref{liportho}
and \ref{chibasistmp} are orthonormal with respect to a weight function of 1. 
However, because the functions are integrated with quadrature weights not 
equal to one, it is necessary to redefine the $\chi$ functions of equation 
\ref{chibasistmp} as
\begin{align}
\label{chibasis}
\chi_{\xi,n_\xi}(x)&=\frac{1}{2}\left[\lambda_{\xi,n_\xi}(x)w_{\xi,n_\xi}^{-1/2}+\lambda_{\xi+1,1}(x)w_{\xi,1}^{-1/2}\right] \\
\chi_{\xi,i}(x)&=\lambda_{\xi,i}(x)w_i^{-1/2}, \qquad i=2,n_\xi-1
\end{align}

With this definition, the quadrature integration of the $\chi$ functions obeys the
orthonormality relation, 
\begin{equation}
\label{chiortho}
\sum_{\xi=1}^N\sum_{i=1}^{n_\xi}\chi_{\alpha,j}(x_{\xi,i})\chi_{\beta,k}(x_{\xi,i})w_{\xi,i}
=\delta_{\alpha,\beta}\delta_{j,k}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of elements. 


\section{Construction of DVR Matricies in One Dimension}
\subsection{Standard DVR Review}
The benefit of using the Discrete Variable Representation is that many of the
integrals that are normally involved in using a basis expansion never need to be
calculated. Much more information on the theory of the DVR method is available in
literature\cite{DVR1986,DVR1990}. In short, the idea is to use a transformation on the 
potential matrix of the Hamiltonian such that the potential matrix is diagonal with
each diagonal element represented by the value of the potential at a quadrature 
point. 
The standard method to construct the potential matrix in some given basis 
is to compute each matrix element using quadrature integration, as
\begin{equation}
\label{Vmatel}
V_{\alpha,\beta}=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\phi_{\alpha}(x_{i})w_i^{1/2}V(x_{i})\phi_{\beta}(x_{i})w_{i}^{1/2}
\end{equation}
By inspection, the terms $\phi_\alpha(x_i)w_i^{1/2}$ can be written as matricies with elements
labed by $\alpha$ and $i$, and these matrices diagonalize the potential matrix. 
\begin{equation}
\label{Vdiag}
{\bf V}={\bf D} {\bf V_d} {\bf D^T}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{Vdiagdef}
{\bf V_d}=
\begin{pmatrix}
V(x_1) & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & V(x_2) & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 &\ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \dots & V(x_M) 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The transformation matrix, which is the DVR matrix, ${\bf D}$, is a matrix
of the basis functions evaluated at the quadrature points and multiplied by the 
square root of the weight associated with that point. 
\begin{equation}
\label{Dmatrix}
{\bf D}=
\begin{pmatrix}
\phi_1(x_1)w_1^{1/2} & \phi_1(x_2)w_2^{1/2} & \phi_1(x_3)w_3^{1/2} & \dots & \phi_1(x_M)w_M^{1/2} \\
\phi_2(x_1)w_1^{1/2} & \phi_2(x_2)w_2^{1/2} & \phi_2(x_3)w_3^{1/2} & \dots & \phi_2(x_M)w_M^{1/2} \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\phi_M(x_1)w_1^{1/2} & \phi_M(x_2)w_2^{1/2} & \phi_M(x_3)w_3^{1/2} & \dots & \phi_M(x_M)w_M^{1/2} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

From orthonormalization it is clear that ${\bf DD^T} = {\bf 1}$, the unit matrix. From use
of the Cristoffel-Darboux Identity\cite{CD3T}, and the fact that ${\bf D}$ is a unitary matrix, 
it is also true that ${\bf D^TD}={\bf 1}$. 

\subsection{DVR Matrix with Finite Element Basis}
If only a single element is used for the entire integration range, then employing the 
Lagrange Interpolating Polynomials in the DVR is as simple as replacing the general $\phi$
functions in equation \ref{Dmatrix} with the $\chi$ functions defined in equation \ref{chibasis}.
For multiple elements, some care must be taken because of the ``bridging'' functions. 
If one were to use the LIP basis without the bridging functions and simply use the full 
basis of all the polynomials from each element, then the DVR matrix would be block-diagonal;
each block of the DVR matrix would correspond to a finite element, and 
the definition of equation \ref{lipdomain} would ensure no 
coupling between different blocks. 

However, with the necessary bridging functions, the DVR matrix blocks share the diagonal, corner
matrix elements of each block with the blocks before and after it. 
A two-element FEM-DVR matrix, each finite element with 4 points would have the following form
\begin{equation}
\label{dvrxmpl} 
{\bf D} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\phi_1(x_1)w^{1/2}_1 & \phi_1(x_2)w^{1/2}_2 & \phi_1(x_3)w^{1/2}_3 & \phi_1(x_4)w^{1/2}_4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\phi_2(x_1)w^{1/2}_1 & \phi_2(x_2)w^{1/2}_2 & \phi_2(x_3)w^{1/2}_3 & \phi_2(x_4)w^{1/2}_4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\phi_3(x_1)w^{1/2}_1 & \phi_3(x_2)w^{1/2}_2 & \phi_3(x_3)w^{1/2}_3 & \phi_3(x_4)w^{1/2}_4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\phi_4(x_1)w^{1/2}_1 & \phi_4(x_2)w^{1/2}_2 & \phi_4(x_3)w^{1/2}_3 & \phi_4(x_4)w^{1/2}_4 & \phi_4(x_5)w^{1/2}_5 & \phi_4(x_6)w^{1/2}_6 & \phi_4(x_7)w^{1/2}_7 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \phi_5(x_4)w^{1/2}_4 & \phi_5(x_5)w^{1/2}_5 & \phi_5(x_6)w^{1/2}_6 & \phi_5(x_7)w^{1/2}_7 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \phi_6(x_4)w^{1/2}_4 & \phi_6(x_5)w^{1/2}_5 & \phi_6(x_6)w^{1/2}_6 & \phi_6(x_7)w^{1/2}_7 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \phi_7(x_4)w^{1/2}_4 & \phi_7(x_5)w^{1/2}_5 & \phi_7(x_6)w^{1/2}_6 & \phi_7(x_7)w^{1/2}_7 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

For two elements with four points in each, and thus sharing the point at the boundary 
separating the elements, gives a $7\times7$ matrix. Here the functions have been indexed
directly rather than specifying another index for the element. Function $4$ in equation 
\ref{dvrxmpl} is the bridging function between the elements. 
This form for the DVR matrix shows the ``linked-diagonal-block'' form of the matrix, 
which again is a result of the bridging function ensuring continuity. 

\appendix
\section{Proof of Lobatto Integration Formula}
\label{lobatappend}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{General Quadrature Proof}
\label{genproof}
A Gaussian-type quadrature formula for approximating an integral is based off of
a set of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to a weighting function over
the range of integration. For the Legendre polynomials, the range of integration is 
$[-1,1]$ and the weight function is 1. 

For any given set of $n$ quadrature abscissas,$\{x\}_n$, weights can be calculated to make
the following summation exact, 
\begin{equation}
\intunit f(x)\dx = \sum_{i=1}^nw_if(x_i)
\end{equation}
for all $f$ if $f$ is a polynomial of order $n-1$ or less. An improvement can be made
by specifying a set of abscissas. In the example of Legendre polynomials (and this holds
true for other orthogonal polynomials and their related quadrature formulas), the set
of points is chosen to be the roots of the $P_n(x)$ Legendre polynomial. Using these
abscissas and then calculating the weights ensures a quadrature that will exactly 
integrate any polynomial of order $2n-1$. This can be shown as follows
\cite{Burden_gaussquad}, 

Say $g(x)$ is a polynomial of order no greater than $2n-1$. This polynomial can be
written as 
\begin{equation}
\label{genproof1}
g(x)=q(x)P_n(x)+r(x)
\end{equation}
where $q(x)$ is the dividend after dividing $g(x)$ by $P_n(x)$, and $r(x)$ is the 
remainder. If $g(x)$ is of order $2n-1$ or less, then both $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ cannot
be of order greater than $n-1$. As such, both $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ can be represented
as a linear combination of the set of Legendre polynomials of order $n-1$ and less. 
Integrating equation \ref{genproof1} gives, 
\begin{align}
\label{genproof2}
\intunit g(x)\dx &= \intunit q(x)P_n(x)\dx + \intunit r(x)\dx \\
\intunit g(x)\dx &= 0+\intunit r(x)\dx
\end{align}
where the first term on the right-hand side is necessarily zero because if $q(x)$ 
can be represented by an expansion in Legendre polynomials of orders less then $n$, 
then each of these polynomials are orthogonal to $P_n(x)$ with respect to integration.
Therefore, all that is left is the integration over the remainder term. 
In performing the same steps by quadrature, 
\begin{align}
\label{genproof3}
\sumunit g(x_i)w_i &= \sumunit q(x_i)P_n(x_i)w_i + \sumunit r(x_i)w_i \\
\sumunit g(x_i)w_i &= 0+\sumunit r(x_i)w_i
\end{align}
where again the first summation on the right-hand side is zero because the 
abscissa points were chosen to be the roots of $P_n(x)$. Because $r(x)$ is of
order $n-1$ or less, this term can be integrated exactly by quadrature, and thus
$g(x)$ is integrated exactly. Thus for any polynomial $g(x)$ of order $2n-1$, 
the $n$ point quadrature can be made to be exact, giving
\begin{equation}
\intunit g(x)\dx = \sumunit g(x_i)w_i
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Lobatto Quadrature Proof}
\label{lobattoproof}
The Lobatto integration formula is 
\begin{equation}
\label{lobatint_proof}
\intunit f(x) \approx \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\left[f(-1)+f(1)\right]+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1}w_if(x_i)
\end{equation}
where the abscissas, $x_i$ are the $i^{th}$ root of $P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$, $P_n(x)$ being the 
$n^{th}$ Legendre polynomial, and the interior weights, $w_i$ are given by the formula
\begin{equation}
\label{weightform}
w_i=\frac{2}{n(n-1)[P_{n-1}(x)]^2}
\end{equation}
This integration quadrature is exact for all functions $f(x)$ such that $f(x)$ is a
polynomial of order $2n-3$ or less. The proof of this relies on the Legendre Polynomial
recursion relation \cite{LegendrePoly},
\begin{equation}
\label{P3term}
(n+1)P_{n+1}(x)=(2n+1)xP_n(x)-nP_{n-1}(x) 
\end{equation}
and the Legendre polynomial derivative formula \cite{LegendrePoly}
\begin{align}
\label{P3der}
(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n}(x) &= -nxP_n(x)+nP_{n-1}(x) \\
  {}  &=(n+1)\left[xP_n(x)-P_{n+1}(x)\right]
\end{align}
The main difference between the Lobatto Quadrature formula and other Gaussian-type
quadratures is that the end points of the integration range ($[-1,1]$, generally) are
included as quadrature points. By including these points explicitly, two degrees 
of freedom are lost, and thus the quadrature is not as accurate as the general case. 

By including the end points, the abscissas for Lobatto quadrature are the roots
of the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Phidef1}
\Phi_n(x)=(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x)
\end{equation}
That these abscissas are those that provide the maximum accuracy is proven 
in a subsequent section. 

The function $\Phi_n(x)$ is a polynomial of order $n$ and has roots at $x=-1,1$. 
From the relations given in equations \ref{P3term} and \ref{P3der}, equation \ref{Phidef1}
can be rewritten, 
\begin{align}
\label{Phidef2}
\Phi_n(x)&=(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x) \nonumber \\
&=(n-1)P_{n-2}(x)-(n-1)xP_{n-1}(x) \nonumber \\
&=(n-1)P_{n-2}(x)-\frac{n-1}{2n-1}\left(nP_n(x)+(n-1)P_{n-2}(x)\right) \nonumber \\
&=\frac{n(n-1)}{2n-1}\left(P_{n-2}(x)-P_n(x)\right)
\end{align}
From here the proof proceeds in the same way as in the general case. 
Given a polynomial, $g(x)$ that is of order $2n-3$ or less, it can be written 
similarly to equation \ref{genproof1}, but now we use the $\Phi$ function instead of 
a Legendre Polynomial as the divisor, 
\begin{align}
\label{gproof1}
g(x)&=q(x)\Phi_n(x)+r(x) \nonumber \\
g(x)&=q(x)\frac{n(n-1)}{2n-1}\left(P_{n-2}(x)-P_n(x)\right) +r(x) 
\end{align}
If $g(x)$ is of order $2n-3$ or less, then $q(x)$ is of order $n-3$ or less. The remainder
$r(x)$ is of order $n-1$ or less, as the highest order possible of the remainder is always one
less than then divisor. Preceding as before by integrating both sides gives
\begin{equation}
\label{gproof2}
\intunit g(x)\dx = \intunit q(x)\frac{n(n-1)}{2n-1}\left(P_{n-2}(x)-P_n(x)\right)\dx + \intunit r(x)\dx 
\end{equation}
In general, the first term on the right-hand side is only zero if $q(x)$ can be 
expanded in Legendre Polynomials of order $n-3$ or less, due to the presence of the
$P_{n-2}(x)$ polynomial. It is possible that $q(x)$ have order $n-1$, but only if 
$q(x)$ and $P_{n-2}(x)$ remain orthogonal, and this is generally not the case. 
After integration, we again have the condition
\begin{equation}
\label{gproof3}
\intunit g(x)\dx = \intunit r(x)\dx 
\end{equation}

Performing the Lobatto quadrature on equation \ref{gproof1} behaves similarly to the
general quadrature case. 
\begin{align}
\label{gproof4}
\sumunit g(x_i)w_i &= \sumunit q(x_i)w_i\frac{n(n-1)}{2n-1}\left(P_{n-2}(x_i)-P_n(x_i)\right) + \sumunit r(x_i)w_i \nonumber \\
\sumunit g(x_i)w_i &= 0 + \sumunit r(x_i)w_i
\end{align}
where again the first term on the right-hand side is zero because the quadrature
abscissas were chosen to be roots of $\Phi(x)$ (as defined in equation \ref{Phidef2}). 

Therefore it is proved that the $n$-point Lobatto Quadrature is exact for all 
polynomials of order $2n-3$. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Proof of Weight Formula for Lobatto Quadrature}
Because the Lobatto integration formula exactly integrates any polynomial of order
$2n-3$ or less, integrating a Lagrange interpolating polynomial can be done by 
quadrature exactly. A Lagrange interpolating polynomial is defined in equation 
\ref{lipdef} and rewritten here for convenience, 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_k(x)=\prod_{j \ne k}^n\frac{(x-x_j)}{(x_k-x_j)} \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_k(x_k)=1$ by definition and is zero at all other quadrature abscissas. 
Integrating this function produces the quadrature result, 
\begin{align}
\label{lipint1}
\intunit \lambda_k(x)\dx &= \sumunit \lambda_k(x_i)w_i \nonumber \\
&= w_k\lambda_k(x_k) = w_k
\end{align}
Therefore a formula for the integration of $\lambda_k(x)$ will result in 
an expression for the weight factors. 

The Lagrange interpolating polynomial can also be written in another form
based on the Legendre Polynomials. Since the $\lambda_k(x)$ functions share
all the same roots as the expression $(1-x*2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)$ except for
the $k^{th}$ root, $\lambda_k(x)$ can be defined as
\begin{equation}
\lambda_k(x)=Q\frac{(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{(x-x_k)}
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is a normalizing factor that ensures $\lambda_k(x_k)=1$. 
The normalization factor $Q$ can be calculated by use of l'Hopital's rule
applied to $\lambda_k(x)$ or more simply by the identity \cite{Dahlquist_gaussquad}
\begin{equation}
\label{lipdef2}
\lambda_k(x)=\frac{\Phi(x)}{(x-x_k)\Phi^\prime(x_k)}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi(x)=(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$ and is also defined in equations \ref{Phidef1}
and \ref{Phidef2}. Equation \ref{lipdef2} is easy to prove given that all terms in 
$\Phi^\prime(x)$ that contain the $(x-x_k)$ factor after differentiation are zero when
$\Phi^\prime(x)$ is evaluated at $x=x_k$. 
The result is that with normalizing, 
\begin{equation}
\label{lipdef3}
\lambda_k(x)=\frac{(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{(x-x_k)(1-x_k^2)P^{\prime\prime}(x_k)}
\end{equation}

It is now left to prove that integrating this expression for $\lambda_k(x)$ gives
the weight formula defined in equation \ref{weightform}
\begin{align}
\intunit \lambda_k(x)\dx & = \intunit \frac{(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{(x-x_k)(1-x_k^2)P_{n-1}^{\prime\prime}(x_k)} \nonumber \\
 & = \frac{1}{(1-x_k^2)P^{\prime\prime}_{n-1}(x_k)} \intunit \frac{(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{(x-x_k)} \nonumber \\
\label{wform1}
 & = \frac{2}{n(n-1)[P_{n-1}(x_k)]^2} \\
\label{wform2}
 & = \frac{2n}{(1-x_k^2)P^{\prime\prime}_{n-1}(x_k)P^\prime_n(x_k)} 
\end{align}
Where the forms for the weights in equations \ref{wform1}  and \ref{wform2} are given in references
\cite{ABRW-STGN} and \cite{LobattoQuad} respectively. 
From equation \ref{wform2} we can see the proof of the weights reduces to proving the equality
\begin{equation}
\label{weightint}
\intunit \frac{(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{(x-x_k)}\dx = \frac{2n}{P^\prime_n(x_k)}
\end{equation}

From here we shall prove that the interior abscissas are indeed the roots of $P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$
and show how to perform the integral in equation \ref{weightint} to get the formulae for 
the associated weights.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Abscissas}
As noted before, the interior weights can be calculated from the solution
to the integral
\begin{equation}
\intunit \lambda_i(x)\dx = w_i
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_i(x)$ is the Lagrange interpolating polynomial defined by the 
chosen abscissas. For the Lobatto quadrature, the interior abscissas are defined
to be the roots of $P^\prime_{n-1}(x)$, where $P_n(x)$ is the $n^{th}$ Legendre 
polynomial and $n$ is the total number of quadrature points (including the end points). 

This section proves that the best possible abscissas are the roots of $P^\prime_{n-1}(x)$
and proves the formula, equation \ref{weightform}, for the weights. 

First let us presume that we do not know the interior abscissas, but that the
end point abscissas have been forced. Earlier in equation \ref{Phidef1}, $\Phi$
was defined as the polynomial with roots at all of the abscissas. Now let us 
redefine this function as one in which the interior abscissas are unknown, 
\begin{equation}
\label{Phiudef}
\Phi_n(x)=(1-x^2)\phi_{n-2}(x)
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{n-2}(x)$ is some unknown function with $n-2$ real, distinct roots
in the range of $[-1,1]$. Here we will follow the formulation of Hildebrand 
\cite{Hildebrand}, chapters 7-8, on quadratures with assigned abscissas. 
By the methods of section \ref{genproof} we know that maximum accuracy of the 
quadrature is obtained by using the roots of an orthogonal polynomial. We 
therefore make the assertation that $\phi_{n-2}$ is the $(n-2)^{th}$ member of
a set of orthogonal polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to the 
weighting function $\wbar \equiv (1-x^2)$. Based on this assertation, we must
ensure that $\phi_{n-2}$ is orthogonal to all polynomials of degree $n-3$ or less. 
For simplicity in notation, from here on we will set $r=n-2$. 
Thus, 
\begin{equation}
\label{phiortho}
\intunit \wbar(x)\phi_r(x)g_{r-1}(x)\dx=0
\end{equation}
where $g_{r-1}(x)$ is any general polynomial of degree $r-1$ or less. 
Following section 7.5 of Hildebrand\cite{Hildebrand}, we proceed to reform
equation \ref{phiortho} through successive integration-by-parts. In doing
so we require the $r^{th}$ integral of $\wbar(x)\phi_r(x)$, and so we define
this to be the $r^{th}$ derivative of a function $U_r(x)$, 
\begin{equation}
\label{Udef}
\wbar(x)\phi_r(x)=\frac{d^rU_r(x)}{dx^r} = U^{(r)}_r(x)
\end{equation}
and from this equation \ref{phiortho} is now
\begin{equation}
\label{Uortho}
\intunit U^{(r)}_r(x)g_{r-1}(x)\dx = 0
\end{equation}
After $r$ derivatives, the $g_{r-1}(x)$ function is zero and the integral term
vanishes. What is left is $r-1$ surface terms given as
\begin{align}
\label{Usurface}
\left\{ U_r^{(r-1)}(x)g_{r-1}^{(1)}(x)\right. &- U_r^{(r-2)}(x)g_{r-1}^{(2)}(x) + U_r^{(r-3)}(x)g_{r-1}^{(3)}(x) + \dots \nonumber \\
 \dots &+ \left. \left. (-1)^{r-1}U_r(x)g_{r-1}^{(r-1)}(x)\right\} \right|_{-1}^{+1}  = 0
\end{align}
That the sum of the surface terms is zero is necessary to ensure that the integral
in equation \ref{Uortho} is  zero. Because $g_{r-1}(x)$ can be {\it any} 
polynomial of degree $r-1$ or less, there are no constraints on its value at 
$x=\pm1$. Therefore, we have the constraint on $U_r(x)$ that 
\begin{equation}
\label{Uend}
U_r^{(r-k)}(-1)=U_r^{(r-k)}(1)=0, \quad\quad k=1,2,\dots,r
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we have the requirement that if $\phi_r(x)$ is a polynomial of
degree $r$, its $(r+1)^{th}$ derivative must vanish. From this requirement 
and equation \ref{Udef}, $U_r(x)$ must be a solution to the differential equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Udifeq}
\frac{d^{r+1}}{dx^{r+1}}\left[\frac{1}{\wbar(x)}\frac{d^rU_r(x)}{dx^r}\right]=
\frac{d^{r+1}}{dx^{r+1}}\left[\frac{1}{(1-x^2)}\frac{d^rU_r(x)}{dx^r}\right]=0
\end{equation}
where $U_r(x)$ must satisfy the conditions of equation \ref{Uend}. 

From looking at equation \ref{Udifeq}, we can see that the $1/(1-x^2)$ term may
be problematic; no number of successive derivatives cause this term to vanish. 
Therefore, this term must be cancled from the $U_r^{(r)}(x)$ term. Still requiring 
that equation \ref{Udifeq} be zero then allows $U_r(x)$ to be a polynomial of order
$2r+2$. The requirement of equation \ref{Usurface} leads us to try a function for $U_r(x)$
of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{U1}
U_r(x)=C_{r,1}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x^2-1)^{r+2}-C_{r,2}(x^2-1)^r
\end{equation}
Where $C_{r,1}$ and $C_{r,2}$ is a constant coefficient. 
Clearly this function has an order of $2r+2$, and though it may seem strange to chose 
this function, the reasons will be made clear shortly. We are free to choose these
coefficients provided that the roots of $\phi_r$ remain the same and the requirement
of equation \ref{Usurface} is maintained. The use of the $(x^2-1)$ terms ensure that 
the conditions of equation \ref{Usurface} are met; each term in the first $r$ derivatives
of this definition of $U_r(x)$ contain at least on $(x^2-1)$ term and are thus zero at
$x=\pm1$.  After $r$ applications of the derivative operator with respect to $x$ and
division by $\wbar(x)$, 
$U_r^{(r)}(x)$ is a polynomial of order $r=n-2$, and thus also satisfies the condition 
of equation \ref{Udifeq}, which is to say the $(r+1)^{th}$ derivative of this polynomial
is zero. Hence, all conditions on the form of $U_r(x)$ are met. 

In order to find $\phi_r(x)$, we must work out the explicit form of $U_r^{(r)}(x)$. 
We first apply the derivative operators, and since the conditions from the surface terms
are met, those of equation \ref{Usurface}, by the $(x^2-1)$ terms, we are free to 
manipulate the coefficients later. Applying $d^r/dx^r$ to equation \ref{U1}, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{U2}
\frac{d^r}{dx^r}U_r(x)=C_{r,1}\frac{d^{r+2}}{dx^{r+2}}(x^2-1)^{r+2}-C_{r,2}\frac{d^r}{dx^r}(x^2-1)^r
\end{equation}
Observing that there is a similarity in this terms to the Rodrigues formula for the 
Legendre polynomials, defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{RodriguesLegendre}
P_l(x)=\frac{1}{2^ll!}\frac{d^l}{dx^l}(x^2-1)^l
\end{equation}
We can simplify this equation by the choice of the coefficients to be
\begin{align}
\label{Crcoef1}
C_{r,1}&=-C\frac{(r+1)(r+2)}{2r+1}\frac{1}{2^{r+2}(r+2)!} \\
\label{Crcoef2}
C_{r,2}&=C\frac{(r+1)(r+2)}{2r+1}\frac{1}{2^{r}r!} 
\end{align}
and rewrite equation \ref{U2} as
\begin{align}
\frac{d^r}{dx^r}U_r(x) &= -C\frac{(r+1)(r+2)}{2r+1}\left[ \frac{1}{2^{r+2}(r+2)!}\frac{d^{r+2}}{dx^{r+2}}(x^2-1)^{r+2}-\frac{1}{2^rr!}\frac{d^r}{dx^r}(x^2-1)^r\right] \\
\frac{d^r}{dx^r}U_r(x)&=-C \frac{(r+1)(r+2)}{2r+1}\left[ P_{r+2}(x)-P_r(x) \right] 
\end{align}
again with $r=n-2$, then we have the following algebraic sequence, 
\begin{align}
\frac{d^r}{dx^r}U_r(x) &= -\frac{C(r+1)(r+2)}{2r+1}\left[ P_{r+2}(x)-P_r(x) \right]  \\
\frac{d^{n-2}}{dx^{n-2}}U_{n-2}(x) &= -\frac{Cn(n-1)}{2n-1}\left[ P_{n}(x)-P_{n-2}(x) \right]  \\
 &= C\frac{-n^2+n}{2n-1}\left[ P_{n}(x)-P_{n-2}(x) \right]  \\
 &= C\frac{n^2-n(2n-1)}{2n-1}P_{n}(x)-\frac{n(n-1)}{2n-1}P_{n-2}(x)   \\
\label{ptmp1}
 &= C\frac{n^2}{2n-1}P_n(x)-nP_{n}(x)-\frac{n(n-1)}{2n-1}P_{n-2}(x)   \\
\label{ptmp2}
 &= C\left(nxP_{n-1}(x)-nP_{n}(x)\right)\\
\label{ptmp3}
 &=C(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x)
\end{align}
where the step between lines \ref{ptmp1} and \ref{ptmp2} utilizes the three-term
recurrance relationship of 
\begin{equation}
nxP_{n-1}(x)=\frac{n^2}{2n-1}P_n(x)+\frac{n(n-1)}{2n-1}P_{n-2}(x)
\end{equation}
and between lines \ref{ptmp2} and \ref{ptmp3} the Legendre derivative 
equation is used, 
\begin{equation}
(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x)=nxP_{n-1}(x)+nP_{n}(x)
\end{equation}

Placing $U_r^{(r)}(x)=C(1-x^2)P_{r+1}^\prime(x)=(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$ into 
equation \ref{Udifeq} gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}}\left[ \frac{1}{(1-x^2)}C(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x) \right]=0
\end{equation}
which is true, being that $P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$ is a polynomial of order $n-2$, 
the $(n-1)^{th}$ derivative of it must vanish. Therefore, the polynomial that
we are seeking, $\phi_{n-2}(x)$, is equal or proportional to $P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$. 
The coefficient $C$ is determined such that the lowest order
polynomial of this set, $\phi_0(x)=CP_1^\prime(x)=1$ which give $C=1$. 
Therefore, $\phi_{n-2}(x)=P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$, and  is a member of a set that are 
orthogonal with respect to the weighting function $(1-x^2)$. 

This proves that for an $n$ point quadrature including the end points, the interior
abscissas are in fact the roots of $P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{End Point Weights}
Following is the proof for the end-point weights for the Lobatto Quadrature. From 
equation \ref{lobatint_proof} we can see that at the end points of $x=\pm 1$ the 
quadrature weight is $2/(n(n-1))$. To prove this we need to evaluate the integral of 
equation \ref{weightint} for the abscissas $x=\pm1$. For $x=1$, this is
\begin{equation}
\label{w_xp_1}
\intunit \frac{\beta(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{(1-x)}\dx = w_{x=1}
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is the normalization factor to ensure that the polynomial is equal 
to $1$ at $x=1$. Because the numerator factors directly, l'Hopital's rule is unnecessary
to find the normalization, and the integral can be written simply as
\begin{equation}
\label{w_xp_2}
\intunit \frac{(1+x)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{2P^\prime_{n-1}(1)}\dx = w_{x=1}
\end{equation}

First we must evaluate the expression $2P^\prime_{n-1}(1)$. The first several values
of $P^\prime_m(x=1)$ are
\begin{align}
\label{Ppat1}
P^\prime_0(1) &=0 \nonumber \\
P^\prime_1(1) &=1 \nonumber \\
P^\prime_2(1) &=3 \nonumber \\
P^\prime_3(1) &=6 \nonumber \\
P^\prime_4(1) &=10
\end{align}
and so on. From observation we can see there is a formula of 
\begin{equation}
\label{Ppat1_2}
P^\prime_n(1)=\sum_i^ni = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}
This relation can also be proved from the recursion relation and the definition
of the Legendre polynomials. Using equation \ref{Ppat1_2} to rewrite equation 
\ref{w_xp_2} gives
\begin{equation}
\label{w_xp_3}
\intunit \frac{(1+x)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{n(n-1))}\dx = w_{x=1}
\end{equation}
This integral can now be evaluated by integration-by-parts, 
\begin{align}
n(n-1)w_{x=1} &= \intunit (1+x)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)\dx \nonumber\\
&= \intunit P^\prime_{n-1}(x)\dx + \intunit xP^\prime_{n-1}(x)\dx \nonumber \\
&= P_{n-1}(x)\vert^1_{-1} + xP_{n-1}(x) \vert^1_{-1} - \intunit P_{n-1}(x)\dx \nonumber \\
&= P_{n-1}(1)-P_{n-1}(-1)+P_{n-1}(1)+P_{n-1}(-1) - 0 \nonumber \\
&= P_{n-1}(1)+P_{n-1}(1)\nonumber \\
\label{xp_int}
&=2
\end{align}
Note that $P_l(1)=1$ for all $l$, and the integral over any Legendre polynomial
other than $P_0(x)$ is zero. Since $n$ represents the number of points in the integration,
a one point quadrature is meaningless, since at the very least we count the end points.  
Therefore, we can rule out the integral over $P_{n-1}$ 
surviving. Thus for $w_{x=1}$ we have
\begin{equation}
w_{x=1}=\frac{2}{n(n-1)}
\end{equation}
just as in equation \ref{lobatint_proof}. 

For the weight at $x=-1$, the procedure is very similar, but because the Legendre
polynomials are alternatively even and odd, their values at $x=-1$ alternate 
between $\pm1$ and the derivatives, while still the same magnitude as those
at $x=1$, also alternate between positive and negative.  
The formula for the derivative value at $x=-1$ is 
\begin{equation}
\label{w_xn_1}
P^\prime_{n-1}=\frac{1}{2}(-1)^nn(n-1)
\end{equation}
The integral to be solved is
\begin{equation}
\label{w_xn_2}
\intunit \frac{(-1)^n(1-x)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{n(n-1))}\dx = w_{x=1}
\end{equation}
and proceding as before in equation \ref{xp_int}
\begin{align}
n(n-1)w_{x=-1} &= \intunit (1-x)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)\dx \nonumber \\
&= \intunit P^\prime_{n-1}(x)\dx - \intunit xP^\prime_{n-1}(x)\dx \nonumber \\
&= P_{n-1}(x)\vert^1_{-1} - xP_{n-1}(x) \vert^1_{-1} + \intunit P_{n-1}(x)\dx \nonumber \\
&= P_{n-1}(1)-P_{n-1}(-1)+P_{n-1}(1)+P_{n-1}(-1) - 0 \nonumber \\
&= P_{n-1}(-1)+P_{n-1}(-1) = 2(-1)^n
\label{xn_int}
\end{align}
which gives
\begin{equation}
w_{x=-1}=\frac{(-1)^n2}{(-1)^nn(n-1)} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
\end{equation}
and so the values of the weights at $x=\pm1$ are proved.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Interior Weights}
Here we wish to prove that the values for the interior integration weights is given 
by the formulae, 
\begin{equation}
\label{weightform2}
w_i=\frac{2}{n(n-1)[P_{n-1}(x)]^2} = -\frac{2n}{(1-x_i^2)P_{n-1}^{\prime\prime}(x_i)P_n^\prime(x_i)}
\end{equation}

Beginning with equation \ref{weightint} and the knowledge that $P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$ is
the $(n-2)^{th}$ member of a set of polynomials orthogonal with respect to $(1-x^2)$, 
we can now exactly calculate the integral, 
\begin{equation}
\label{pint}
\intunit \frac{(1-x^2)P^\prime_{n-1}(x)}{(x-x_i)}\dx = \frac{2n}{P^\prime_n(x_i)} \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ root of $P^\prime_{n-1}(x)$.

Keeping the simpler notation of $\phi_r(x)=P_{n-1}^\prime(x)$ with $r=n-2$, we make
use of the Christoffel-Darboux identity \cite{Hildebrand}, 
\begin{equation}
\label{CDident}
\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{\phi_k(x)\phi_k(y)}{\gamma_k}=\frac{\phi_{m+1}(x)\phi_m(y)-\phi_m(x)\phi_{m+1}(y)}{a_m\gamma_m(x-y)}
\end{equation}
where $a_m=A_{m+1}/A_m$ with $A_m$ is the coeffcient of the $x^m$ term of $\phi_m(x)$, and $\gamma_m$ 
is defined as \
\begin{equation}
\label{gammadef}
\gamma_m=\intunit w(x)\left(\phi_m(x)\right)^2\dx
\end{equation}

Now we define $y=x_i$, where $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ root of the $\phi_m(x)$ polynomial. 
With this definition, equation \ref{CDident} becomes, 
\begin{equation}
\label{CDreduced}
\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{\phi_k(x)\phi_k(x_i)}{\gamma_k}=\frac{-\phi_m(x)\phi_{m+1}(x_i)}{a_m\gamma_m(x-x_i)}
\end{equation}

Multiplying both sides of equation \ref{CDreduced} by $(1-x^2)\phi_0(x)$ and integrating gives
\begin{align}
\intunit (1-x^2)\phi_0(x)\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{\phi_k(x)\phi_k(x_i)}{\gamma_k}\dx &= \intunit (1-x^2)\phi_0(x)\frac{-\phi_m(x)\phi_{m+1}(x_i)}{a_m\gamma_m(x-x_i)}\dx \nonumber \\
\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{\phi_k(x_i)}{\gamma_k}\intunit (1-x^2)\phi_0(x)\phi_k(x)\dx &= \intunit (1-x^2)\phi_0(x)\frac{-\phi_m(x)\phi_{m+1}(x_i)}{a_m\gamma_m(x-x_i)}\dx \nonumber \\
\frac{\phi_0(x_i)}{\gamma_0}\gamma_0 &= \intunit \frac{-(1-x^2)\phi_0(x)\phi_m(x)\phi_{m+1}(x_i)}{a_m\gamma_m(x-x_i)}\dx \nonumber \\
\phi_0(x_i)=1 &= \frac{\phi_{m+1}(x_i)}{a_m\gamma_m}\intunit (1-x^2)\phi_0(x)\frac{-\phi_m(x)}{(x-x_i)}\dx \nonumber \\
\label{CDseq}
\frac{-a_m\gamma_m}{\phi_{m+1}(x_i)} &= \intunit (1-x^2)\phi_0(x)\frac{\phi_m(x)}{(x-x_i)}\dx 
\end{align}
Now changing back to Legendre polynomials, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{CDPend}
\intunit \frac{(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x)}{x-x_i}\dx = \frac{-a_{n-1}\gamma_{n-1}}{P_n^\prime(x_i)}
\end{equation}

The leading coefficients of the Legendre polynomials is given by $A_n=(2n)!/[2^n(n!)^2]$, and 
therefore the leading coefficients of $P_n^\prime(x)$, $A^\prime_n$, are given by  
\begin{align}
\label{Aprime}
A^\prime_n&=\frac{n(2n)!}{2^n(n!)^2} \\
a_{n-1}&=\frac{A^\prime_n}{A^\prime_{n-1}}\\
&=\frac{n(2n)!2^{n-1}((n-1)!)^2}{(n-1)(2n-2)!2^n(n!)^2} \\
&= \frac{2n-1}{n-1}
\end{align}
It can also be shown that 
\begin{equation}
\label{gammasolve}
\gamma_{n-1}=\intunit(1-x^2)\left(P_{n-1}^\prime(x)\right)^2 \dx = \frac{2n(n-1)}{2n-1}
\end{equation}
Employing these values for $a_{n-1}$ and $\gamma_{n-1}$ in equation \ref{CDPend}
we have 
\begin{equation}
\intunit \frac{(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^\prime(x)}{x-x_i}\dx = \frac{2n}{P_n^\prime(x_i)}
\end{equation}
which is precisely equation \ref{pint}, which we initially set out to prove, and we 
are left with the equation 
\begin{equation}
\label{weightform3}
w_i= -\frac{2n}{(1-x_i^2)P_{n-1}^{\prime\prime}(x_i)P_n^\prime(x_i)}
\end{equation}
for the interior integration weights. 

This concludes the derivation of the Lobatto Quadrature.
